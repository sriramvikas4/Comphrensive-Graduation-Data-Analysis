**Graduate Statistics Visualization**

This repository contains a visualization of graduate statistics, including employment income, educational qualifications, gender distribution, and field of study. The data is presented in a clear and concise manner, making it easy to understand and interpret.

**Problem Statement**

In a rapidly evolving job market, understanding how different factors such as education, gender, and field of study affect graduate employment outcomes is crucial. Employers, policymakers, and academic institutions need data-driven insights to make informed decisions about career planning, workforce development, and educational investments. However, accessing and interpreting this data can be challenging due to its complexity and volume.

**Solution**
This project offers an interactive and easy-to-understand visualization that analyzes key factors influencing graduate employment outcomes. By leveraging Tableau and publicly available data, we provide insights into:

Median employment income after graduation.
The impact of educational qualifications on income levels.
Gender distribution across various fields of study.
Popularity of different fields of study among graduates.
The data visualization simplifies complex datasets into easily digestible insights, helping stakeholders make better decisions regarding education and career pathways.
